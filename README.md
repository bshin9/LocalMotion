## LocalMotion

We are a group dedicated to solving the crisis of econonmic mobility that has plagued our communities in North Carolina. We want to provide an alternative solution because the solution originally was to push education, but it has become quite clear that education alone is simply not the answer. College education in North Carolina is too expensive as it currently stands which means that it is up to us to find different solutions. Our app is tackling the problem in a substantial way that we feel our competitors are not. We have created an app designed to help people micro-finance and put it towards clothing, internet, and impactful assets that are designated to promote individual's ablitiy to obtain jobs.

## Our Proposal

  Our society has digitized, but as a result, many low-income families are locked out. DataUSA states Charlottes population stands at 859,052. 464,456 are employed, what about the other half?  A recent Pew Research report notes that three out ten adults with house-hold incomes below $30,000 do not have access to a smartphone. It is a challenge for adults without digital devices or internet access to search for and apply to jobs. Members of our team have first-hand experience with this struggle. Our proposal is to connect donors with the under-resourced to provide the fundamentals to compete for jobs and joining the workforce. These fundamentals include items such as internet access, digital devices, work attire, transportation, mentoring, certifications and others. Our platform is a ‘micro Kickstarter’ for upward economic mobility.

  Our application, entitled “LocalMotion”, covers accessibility, practicalities and an enjoyable user experience. Our app targets a specific demographic among low-income or no-income individuals. This demographic covers those who lack the most fundamental provisions required to successfully compete for and land a job. The process is straightforward. A person can post a need, with a description of how this will help them gain employment.  The list of needs will be curated to ensure we target those at the ‘starting line’ of the economy. Donors will be able to contribute financial or other resources to address the need. We provide a matching service and will manage the distribution of resources accordingly.
  
  The mentors are volunteers seeking to make a difference and are only expected to interact with the user once a week. We believe resumes are what leads the foot into the door of the interview. In that case, we have added resume workshops to assist our user’s preparation. Our generous donors deserve credibility, depending on the magnitude of the donation towards us or the user, there will be future plans of acquiring shares or being posted online on the “Donate” blog page of our application. Online videos, tests and quizzes will be made available to help the users become more knowledgeable and prepared for their succeeding future.
Of course FinTech plays a role in our solution. Receiving help from FinTech for our exposure would be the outset!
LocalMotion will achieve the change for the future of Charlotte’s economic mobility. Our solution is to impact the people who are in need of help by raising awareness to the reaching hand that is our app.
